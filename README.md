# multimelt
This is a package containing the most prominent parameterisations for the melt at the base of Antarctic ice shelves

To use this package, clone the github repository locally and install it into you python/conda environment via <code>pip install .</code>

It contains two example python notebooks:
- prepare_mask_example.ipynb : a script using geometric circum-Antarctic input to produce masks of the ice shelves, and the needed box characteristics and plume characteristics
- compute_melt_example.ipynb : a script showing how to apply the melting functions

More detailed explanations and documentation coming soon...
