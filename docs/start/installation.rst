How to install
==============

Currently, the easiest is to clone the `multimelt git hub repository <github.com/ClimateClara/multimelt>`_,
go to the repository folder and type:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install . 
  
If you want to modify it locally, you can fork the `multimelt git hub repository <github.com/ClimateClara/multimelt>`_, go to the repository folder and type:
  
.. code-block:: bash

  pip install -e .
  
This package is programmed in python 3.8 and should be working with all `python
versions > 3.8`. Additional requirements are numpy, xarray, pandas, tqdm and dask. (to be refined)
